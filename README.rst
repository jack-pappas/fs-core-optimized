Optimized implementations of F# Core collections.
#################################################

This repository contains optimized implementations of the collections (e.g., Set, Map)
found in the F# Core library (``FSharp.Core``).

These implementations are designed to be **100% compatible** with the original code.
if you find any inconsistency between the implementations, please open an issue here on
GitHub so I can fix it; be sure to include all relevant details.

**UPDATE**: For easier use, I have incorporated these changes into an ``optimized`` branch in my fork of
``fsharp/fsharp``. All you need to do to use these optimized implementations now is to clone my fork,
checkout the ``optimized`` branch, compile and install.
